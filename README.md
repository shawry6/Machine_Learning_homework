Week 11 Machine Learning Homework Repo

This is my submitted assignment. See the README in the Instructions folder within this repo for details of the assignment along with my solution files: 
1. my_credit_risk_resampling.ipynb 
2. my_credit_risk_ensemble.ipynb

Not sure it's enjoyable for you to read but it was kinda fun for me to do...although I don't think my statistics were correct in the end - too many the same across different sampling methods??
